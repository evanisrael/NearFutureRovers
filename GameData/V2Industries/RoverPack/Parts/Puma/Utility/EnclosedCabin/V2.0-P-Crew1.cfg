	description = Originally a fuel tank, it was drained and seats were fitted. Despite the conversion windows were not cut to regulation size (regulation stating that windows must be big enough for regulation games of i spy to take place), so inside is a rather claustrophobic environment. Because of this, the Kerbals cannot perform crew reports.
