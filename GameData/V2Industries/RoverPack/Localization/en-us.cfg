		#RoverPack-v2ir-puma-crew-enc-titl = R32M Puma Enclosed Crew Tank
		#RoverPack-v2ir-puma-crew-enc-desc = Originally a fuel tank, it was drained and seats were fitted. Despite the conversion windows were not cut to regulation size (regulation stating that windows must be big enough for regulation games of i spy to take place), so inside is a rather claustrophobic environment. Because of this, the Kerbals cannot perform crew reports.

		#RoverPack-v2ir-puma-tank-titl = R32M Puma Tank
		#RoverPack-v2ir-puma-tank-desc = After most of the fuel tanks were converted into the hab boxes, some of them were cut in half and converted back to fuel tanks. The KSC praised the admin staff for their use of bureaucratic Inefficiancy and exorbitant allocation of work hours.
